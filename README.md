## CRITICAL: How to Activate Netlify Forms

If you are deploying to Netlify, you must activate form detection for your new forms to work.

1.  Go to your site's dashboard on Netlify.
2.  Navigate to **Site configuration > Forms**.
3.  Under **Form detection**, ensure it is enabled. If you have just deployed, it should find your forms automatically.

Any form submissions will now appear in your Netlify dashboard's "Forms" section.

## File Structure & Clean URLs (.htaccess)

To provide a professional user experience, your site has been configured to use "clean URLs" (e.g., `yoursite.com/about` instead of `yoursite.com/pages/about.html`).

This is handled by a special configuration file named `.htaccess` that has been automatically added to the root of your project.

**IMPORTANT: This file may be invisible!**
*   Files that start with a dot (`.`) are considered "hidden" by many operating systems (like macOS Finder and Windows Explorer). You might not see it if you unzip the folder and look at it with your standard file manager.
*   You can always see and edit this file in code editors like **VS Code**, or by enabling "Show Hidden Files" in your operating system's settings.
*   This file **must** be present on your web server for the clean URLs to work. Since it's included in this ZIP, you don't need to do anything extra when deploying.

## Spam Filtering & reCAPTCHA

Netlify provides automatic, powerful spam filtering out of the box using Akismet. Because of this, any reCAPTCHA elements provided by Webflow have been **completely removed** from your site's code. This provides a cleaner user experience and relies on Netlify's superior server-side filtering.

A "honeypot" field (invisible to users) has also been added to each form as an additional layer of spam protection.

## Technical Enhancements

*   **Anti-Interference Script:** A small script has been injected to ensure Webflow's native form JavaScript does not interfere with Netlify's form submission process.
*   **Asset Bundling:** All CSS, JavaScript, and image assets have been organized into a clean `assets/` directory structure for easier management.
