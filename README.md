# Your Website - Netlify Ready Edition

Congratulations! Your website has been processed and is ready for a professional deployment on Netlify.

## CRITICAL: How to Activate Netlify Forms

After you deploy your site to Netlify, you must activate form detection for your new forms to work.

1.  Go to your site's dashboard on Netlify.
2.  Navigate to **Site configuration > Forms**.
3.  Under **Form detection**, ensure it is enabled. If you have just deployed, it should find your forms automatically.

Any form submissions will now appear in your Netlify dashboard's "Forms" section.

## Spam Filtering & reCAPTCHA

Netlify provides automatic, powerful spam filtering out of the box using Akismet. Because of this, any reCAPTCHA elements provided by Webflow have been **completely removed** from your site's code. This provides a cleaner user experience and relies on Netlify's superior server-side filtering.

A "honeypot" field (invisible to users) has also been added to each form as an additional layer of spam protection.

## Feature: Clean URLs & Anti-Interference

-   Your site's links will work with "clean" URLs (e.g., `yoursite.com/about/`).
-   A script has been injected to ensure Webflow's native form JavaScript does not interfere with Netlify's form submission process.
