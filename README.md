# Your Website - Netlify Ready Edition

Congratulations! Your website has been processed and is ready for deployment on Netlify.

## Feature: Netlify Forms

Your site's forms have been automatically configured to work with Netlify's form handling. When you deploy the site, any form submissions will appear in your Netlify dashboard.

**How it works:**
- An attribute `data-netlify="true"` has been added to your `<form>` tags.
- A hidden input `<input type="hidden" name="form-name" ...>` has been added to each form.
- A "honeypot" field to catch spam bots has also been included.

There is no further configuration needed. Simply deploy the contents of the ZIP file to Netlify.

## Feature: Clean URLs

Your site's links will appear "clean" (e.g., `yoursite.com/about/`) when hosted. The included `.htaccess` file enables this on traditional servers, and Netlify handles this automatically.

For local viewing, links have been corrected to work properly when you open `index.html` on your computer.
